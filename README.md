Hey there,

This project is mostly about exploring possibilities of the LED Matrix of new Arduino Uno R4 Wifi and a showcase of collection of animations.

There's a growing number of animations prepared with https://ledmatrix-editor.arduino.cc and some additional editing of frames prepared with this tool. At the momenent there's 11 of them, including animations of logo of Arduino, which is of course registered trademark. Project is not commercial as is not meant to be used in any commercial way. 

I used examples from Arduino Uno R4 Wifi package to create it. 

Feel free to play with it!
